        article: `Computer vision is a powerful AI field that allows machines to "see" and interpret the visual world. It's used in everything from medical diagnosis to facial recognition on your phone. This technology has become increasingly important as we rely more on automated systems to interpret and understand visual information from our environment.

What Is Computer Vision?
Computer vision uses AI and machine learning to analyze and extract information from images, videos, and real-world scenes. The goal is to enable computers to perform visual tasks just like humans—or sometimes even better. It involves recognizing patterns, detecting objects, and understanding spatial relationships in visual data.

How It Works
The process of computer vision involves several key steps:

- Noise reduction and image enhancement techniques are applied
- Conversion to different color spaces (RGB, grayscale, etc.)
- Contrast adjustment and edge enhancement

Feature Detection:
- Identification of key points, edges, and corners
- Pattern recognition in textures and shapes
- Segmentation of images into meaningful regions
- Detection of motion in video sequences

Classification & Interpretation:
